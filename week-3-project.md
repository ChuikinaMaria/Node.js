# Week 3 Project

This week's project is to complete as many of the  `node-practice-*` repositories as you can!

Each one is a smallish node project based around a single function.  After passing the tests, you'll need to write a simple CLI & API that allow a user to interact with your function and some files of data.

You will be expected to cleanly develop your project with one branch per step (up to you to decide what a step is!) and complete the README with a report on what you struggled with, what you learned, and what skills you now need to work.   You will be assessed not only on your solutions to the function, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your learning notes in the README.

## Getting Started

* Create an issue for this week's project in your class repo
  * ```YourName: node.js, week 3 project```
* Fork/clone and complete as many of the `node-practice-*` repos as you can! Each time you start a new one, add a link to it in your weekly issue.
  * Begin with [`node-practice-replace`](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/node-practice-replace), then move on from there
* Begin studying!

__Node.js Tutorials__

These tutorials will introduce you to a bunch of new features in Node that you haven't seen in the Browser.  While you're following these tutorials, it's important to remember that at it's core Node.js is still JavaScript.  Everything you've learned so far (except for the DOM & `fetch` :) is still true!  The Event Loop, Classes, Closure, Arrays, Objects, Variables, `this.`, it's all still the same.


The tutorials below will introduce to what's new and what's special about Node.  But don't forget to take some time and solve a few of the JavaScript Exercises above to get used to working with plain, vanilla JS in the terminal.

__API's and Express__

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment capable of writing Web Servers and API's all by itself.  But it's a bit annoying.  Express is a great and easy to use framework to help you write API's and Web Servers by handling all of the boring stuff for you so you can focus on what your app does.

> [Postman](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=postman+tutorials&t=brave&iax=videos&ia=videos) - an app for testing your API's without using a browser.

> [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - An NPM module that starts a RESTful API without you having to write a single line of code.  This can be helpful practice for getting the hang of API's and Postman without getting tripped up by bugs and errors in code you write.
