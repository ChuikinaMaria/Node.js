# Week 1 Project

This week's project is to complete the __PokeDex API__.

But wait!  Passing all the tests is not enough!  You will be expected to cleanly develope your fork with one branch per function and complete the README with a report on what you struggled with, what you learned, and what skills you now need to work.   You will be assessed not only on your solutions to the function, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your learning notes in the README.

## Getting Started

* Fork the [Pokedex Project](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/pokedex-project)
* Create an issue for this week's project in your class repo
    * ```YourName: node.js, week 1 project```
* Begin studying!

### Writing and Debugging JavaScript in Node.js

Before diving right into API's, Express and Servers it's worth spending a day or so just getting used to programming in Node.js.  While the core of JavaScript is still the same there are some new features available in Node.js that weren't available in the browser, and it will take a little time to get used to working with the JS debugger built into VSC.

To get a hang of programming in Node.js take some time to solve the first few of these ...
* [JavaScript Exercises](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/javascript-exercises)
None of the first exercises are very difficult (you've even solved a few of them already!) so they should be a good opportunity to review JS and get used to the Node JS environment.

> You aren't required to complete all of these exercises, but if you don't start them we will raise our eye-brows.  So please include a link to your fork of the `javascript-exercises` in your weekly issue so we can easily find it.

__Node.js Tutorials__

These tutorials will introduce you to a bunch of new features in Node that you haven't seen in the Browser.  While you're following these tutorials, it's important to remember that at it's core Node.js is still JavaScript.  Everything you've learned so far (except for the DOM & `fetch` :) is still true!  The Event Loop, Classes, Closure, Arrays, Objects, Variables, `this.`, it's all still the same.


The tutorials below will introduce to what's new and what's special about Node.  But don't forget to take some time and solve a few of the JavaScript Exercises above to get used to working with plain, vanilla JS in the terminal.

__API's and Express__

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment capable of writing Web Servers and API's all by itself.  But it's a bit annoying.  Express is a great and easy to use framework to help you write API's and Web Servers by handling all of the boring stuff for you so you can focus on what your app does.

> [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - An NPM module that starts a RESTful API without you having to write a single line of code.  This can be helpful practice for getting the hang of API's and Postman without getting caught up with bugs and errors.
